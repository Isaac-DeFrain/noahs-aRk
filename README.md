Here's a crappy start at a [**User's Guide**](./user-guide.md).

## Motivation

Since at least Summer 2018 and probably earlier, we, the Rchain community, a group of people united by our belief in the importance of concurrency in the blockchain and our holdings in the rhoc token, have suffered the poor decision making and dishonesty of Greg Meredith, president of the Rchain cooperative, a legal entity in the legacy legal system of the State of Washington.

Being part of the blockchain community, the Rchain community has known all along that we have the power to fork off, but due partly to Stockholm Syndrome, partly to apathy, and largely to inability to coordinate our efforts, have allowed Greg to hold the reigns.

Recently, despite a very clear plan to issue rev 1:1 to rhoc, Greg has tried to cut out various stakeholders he regards as "scammers" while providing insufficient details about the scams perpetrated. The community has struggled to agree on the issuance of the rev token and is, more than ever, in need of a mechanism of social coordination. For years Greg has promised that Rchain will provide this means, but it never launches and the status quo remains.

Noah's aRk, a blockchain built on the [Substrate](https://substrate.dev) framework, will provide token based voting to settle the rev issuance, and any other disputes arising in the community.

aRk tokens will be issued 1:1 with rhoc tokens from ethereum block height 9371743, the same block the coop announced. Motions may be made to cancel any existing tokens, mint new tokens, run taint analyses, and more. The critical difference is that these motions will pass or fail based on token-backed voting. The exact mechanism comes from Substrate's [Democracy pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_democracy/index.html).

## Current Technical Overview

The code in this repository is based on the [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template). It was developed into a working chain that hopefully meets the needs of the Rchain community February 14-16 at ETH Denver. A testnet will be launched shortly, and the testnet will become mainnet if it is able to represent the will of the community. Relevant aspects of the chain's mechanisms are outlined below.

### The Airdrop

The aRk token is managed by Substrate's [Balances Pallet](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_balances/index.html). aRk must be claimed by a process similar to claiming DOTs on Polkadot or KSM on Kusama. The code that handles these claims is in `pallets/air-drop/src/lib.rs` and is nearly identical to https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/common/src/claims.rs.

### Consensus

Block authoring will be handled by the Babe algorithm with a set of trusted authorities. Authorities will have no external incentive to author blocks, rather they will author because they believe in the project. Authorities may be added to the set by the same governance means as described above. Initially there will be three authorities all run by Joshy, unless other trustworthy and interested parties step forward. The code to manage the validator set is at https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-validator-set and can be easily installed here.

### Governance

As described above, the democracy pallet will be used for governance. Proposals are submitted by locking tokens behind them. Proposals may be seconded by locking more tokens. After a regular interval, the highest staked proposal becomes a referendum and the staking tokens are returned in full. Voting happens by staking tokens behind Aye or Nay vote. Voting power is proportional to the amount of tokens staked and exponential in time staked. After a vote is resolved, the losing side will get their tokens unlocked immediately, giving them a chance to divest in the system. The winning side will get their tokens back when the specified locking period expires. This is the same democratic system used in Polkadot and Kusama. Learn more about voting at:

* [Democracy Reference Docs](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_democracy/index.html)
* [Democracy Source Code](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/democracy/src)

Currently there is also be a [sudo](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_sudo/index.html) key controlled by Joshy to affect upgrades on short notice as necessary. This sudo key can be removed before mainnet launch, depending on community sentiment. The sudo key can also be removed after launch either by the token holders according to the democracy, or by the holder of the sudo key at his or her own will.

## Long Term Technical Possibilities

Initially this project strives only to help the community navigate the turbulence that it has experienced over the past few years. It is entirely possible that it will serve that purpose in a few weeks or months and then die. It is also possible that the community will come to value this chain and the simplicity of developing in Rust on Subststrate to the point that it evolves into #TheRealRchain mainnet. (Of course it's also possible that it will not gain momentum at all, but I hope this isn't the case.) The following sections explore some possibilities for the future of Noah's aRk.

### Consensus

Substrate provides a robust API for plugging consensus algorithms. It is possible to implement CBC Casper, Casanova, or other consensus algorithms in Substrate. Further the chain can be upgraded to use these algorithms after launch.

### Rholang

Substrate provides a robust API for writing runtime logic. The RhoVM could be written in rust, and added to the chain through the same governance process described above.

### Limitless

Anything the community can code in Rust, and gain social support for, can be installed on the chain. Let's experiment and see what we can build together.
